# Atomic Operations vs. Parallel Reductions in CUDA

## Overview

When performing sum reductions or other aggregate operations in CUDA, developers face a choice between using atomic operations and implementing full parallel reductions. This note explains both approaches, their trade-offs, and best practices.

## The Hybrid Approach in Our N-body Simulation

Our energy calculation kernel uses a hybrid approach:

1. First, threads within each block perform a full parallel reduction using shared memory
2. Then, one thread per block uses `atomicAdd` to accumulate the block results into the global sum

```cuda
// Parallel reduction in shared memory
for (int stride = blockDim.x / 2; stride > 0; stride >>= 1) {
    if (tid < stride) {
        sharedEnergy[tid] += sharedEnergy[tid + stride];
    }
    __syncthreads();
}

// Write block's result to global memory with atomic operation
if (tid == 0) {
    atomicAdd(totalEnergy, sharedEnergy[0]);
}
```

## Atomic Operations for Double Precision

Prior to the Pascal architecture (compute capability 6.0), CUDA didn't provide native support for atomic operations on `double` values. For older architectures, a custom implementation is required:

```cuda
#if __CUDA_ARCH__ < 600
__device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val)
{
    unsigned long long int* address_as_ull = (unsigned long long int*)address;
    unsigned long long int old = *address_as_ull, assumed;
    do {
        assumed = old;
        old = atomicCAS(address_as_ull, assumed,
                        __double_as_longlong(val + __longlong_as_double(assumed)));
    } while (assumed != old);
    return __longlong_as_double(old);
}
#endif
```

This implementation uses Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operations and bit casting between doubles and unsigned long long integers.

## Performance Considerations

### Atomic Operations

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- No need for additional kernel launches
- Efficient for low-contention scenarios
- Modern GPUs (compute capability 6.0+) have improved atomic performance

**Cons:**
- Can cause serialization if many threads target the same memory location
- Memory traffic can become a bottleneck
- Slower on pre-Pascal architectures, especially for double precision

### Full Parallel Reductions

**Pros:**
- Maximizes parallelism
- Avoids serialization bottlenecks
- More efficient when reducing large arrays
- Consistent performance across GPU architectures

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- May require multiple kernel launches
- Requires additional temporary storage

## When to Use Each Approach

**Use atomic operations when:**
- The number of blocks is relatively small
- You have a modern GPU with compute capability 6.0+
- Simplicity is more important than absolute performance
- The operation is not in the critical performance path

**Use full parallel reduction when:**
- Working with large data sets
- The reduction is in a performance-critical section
- You need consistent performance across different GPU generations
- Many threads would be targeting the same memory location

## Full Two-Phase Reduction Alternative

If you want to eliminate atomic operations completely, you could implement a two-phase reduction:

```cuda
// Phase 1: Each block reduces its elements
__global__ void blockReductionKernel(double* input, double* blockSums, int n) {
    extern __shared__ double sdata[];
    // ... load data and perform block reduction ...
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        blockSums[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
    }
}

// Phase 2: Reduce the block sums
__global__ void finalReductionKernel(double* blockSums, double* result, int numBlocks) {
    extern __shared__ double sdata[];
    // ... load data and perform block reduction ...
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        *result = sdata[0];
    }
}
```
